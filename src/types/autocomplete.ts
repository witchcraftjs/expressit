/**
 * Contains information regarding the tokens around a cursor position. Mostly for internally use by @see autosuggest.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - There are no whitespace tokens because whitespace is not tokenized. `prev`, `at`, `next` properties that contain tokens are set looking only at the list of tokens extracted from the ast by @see extractTokens. This is why there is an extra `whitespace` property to tell us whether there is whitespace (i.e. a hole) between the cursor and the next/prev **valid** tokens or if it can't find any, the start/end of the input.
 * - If next/prev are invalid tokens, note that there are cases where more invalid tokens might follow them. To get them we can use @see getSurroundingErrors or we can just find their index in the tokens list and go forward/backward as needed:
 * ```ts
 * let i =  tokens.findIndex(t => t === info.next)
 * while (tokens[i] instanceof ErrorToken) {...}
 * ```
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```js
 * aaaa| bbbb // tokens: ["aaaa", TokenError(operator), "bbbb"]
 *     ^
 * {
 * 	index: 4, // cursor position
 * 	at: undefined, // it's not inside a token
 * 	prev: "aaaa",
 * 	next: TokenError, // operator is missing to the right
 * 	// closest valid tokens to either side
 * 	valid: {
 * 		prev: "aaaa",
 * 		next: "bbbb",
 * 	},
 * 	// whether there is whitespace between the cursor and the next/prev valid tokens or start/end of input
 * 	whitespace: {
 * 		prev: false,
 * 		next: true,
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 * ```js
 * aaaa || bb|bb && cccc
 *           ^
 * {
 * 	index: 10,
 * 	at: "bbbb", // it's inside a token
 * 	prev: "||",
 * 	next: "&&",
 * 	valid: {
 * 		prev: "||",
 * 		next: "&&",
 * 	},
 * 	whitespace: {
 * 		prev: true,
 * 		next: true,
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
