	 *
	 * ```js
	 * date>2020
	 * date=(2020 OR 2021)
	 * ```
	 * The same operator as the expanded property separator can be passed and it will take priority (e.g. `{expandedPropertySeparator: ":", customPropertyOperators:[":"]}`).
	 *
	 * For example, we might want `:` to mean `contains`:
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * title:(a OR b) // title:a OR title:B
	 * title:(a AND b) // title:a AND title:B

	 * // if prefixableGroups = true
	 * title:(prefix(a OR B)) // title:prefix.a OR title:prefix.b

	 * Enables regex strings as values. The value is treated as if it was quoted by forward slashes. Any repetition of lowercase characters (even if there are multiple) attached to the end are assumed to be flags and added as a single token to the value's `quotes.mode` property.
	 *
	 * Can be passed a custom function to determine when to use the regex value or not (it is converted to a regular value). The function is passed the property, the operator, and whether it's an expanded operator. If their is an error token for the property or operator, an empty string is passed.
	 *
	 * ```ts
	 * // allow anything (`prop=/val/`, `prop:op:/val`, `prop=(/val/)`, `prop:op(/val/)`) but the value alone (`/regex/`)
	 * regexValues: (property, operator, isExpanded) => return property !== undefined || operator !== undefined

	 * regexValues: (property, operator, isExpanded) => return !isExpanded && operator === "="
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 *
	 * - Usually you should only actually allow `i`, `m`, and `u` since the others would make no sense for a query language and would bring down performance.
	 *
	 * - Unlike quoted values we can't fix errors like `... val/ ...`. If the `/` were a quote, we can tell a quote is missing before the val, but with regexes, it will just swallow ALL the input AFTER.
	 *
	 * There is also the following cases that might seem strange:
	 * ```
	 * ... /[/ ...
	 *     ^start .... no end
	 * ... /[/ ... /...../
	 *     ^       ^     ^
	 *     start   | end | start
	 *
	 * ```
	 * They *seem* to incorrectly swallow all input after or until the next `/`, but this is correct and happens because forward slashes do not need to be escaped inside regex sets (i.e. `[]`). And even if the regex is invalid and the set is never closed, we can't tell the set isn't closed when parsing. This is also why it would be very hard to create smarter errors like quoted values have.

	 *
	 * Given a query object it should return the values of the `value`, `operator`, and `negate` properties that will be assigned to {@link Condition}.
	 *
	 * You can think of the query object as a simplified version of the condition node. See {@link ValueQuery} for details on each property.
	 *
	 * A default function is available, but it just sets the value to the query value, ignoring everything else.
	 *
	 * Example of how you might approach writing a function that handles all the different parser features (groups, prefixed strings, etc):
	 *
	 * ```ts
	 * type RawOperators = ">" | "contains" | // operator types (expanded vs custom) are not distinguished from each other
	 * type RawPrefixes = "num"
	 * type Operators = "contains"
	 *
	 * function conditionNormalizer({ operator, prefix, value, regexFlags, isRegex, isExpanded, isNegated, isQuoted }: ValueQuery): {value:any, operator: Operators} {
	 * 	let finalValue: any = value
	 * 	let finalOperator: any = operator
	 * 	if (prefix) {
	 * 		const val = value as string // it's always a string if prefixed
	 * 		switch (prefix as RawPrefixes) {
	 * 			case "num": finalValue = parseInt(val, 2); break
	 * 			// ...
	 * 		}
	 * 	}
	 * 	// another way to allow special unquoted value types is something like this:
	 * 	if (typeof value === "string" && !isQuoted) {
	 * 		const asNum = parseInt(value, 2)
	 * 		if (!isNaN(asNum)) finalValue = asNum
	 * 		if (["true","false"].includes(value)) {
	 * 			finalValue = value === "true" ? true : false
	 * 		}
	 * 	}
	 * 	if (isRegex) {
	 * 		const val = value as string // it's always a string and never prefixed if it's a regex
	 * 		const regex = new RegExp(val, regexFlags) // this can throw if the user passes invalid flags
	 * 		finalValue = regex
	 * 	}
	 * 	if (operator) {
	 * 		switch (operator as RawOperators) {
	 * 			case ">": {
	 * 				finalOperator = "contains"
	 * 				break
	 * 			}
	 * 			case "contains": {
	 * 				finalOperator = "contains"
	 * 				break
	 * 			}
	 * 		}
	 * 	}
	 * 	return {value: finalValue, operator: finalOperator, negate: isNegated }
	 * }
	 * ```
	 * In this example, nothing was done with `isNegated`, but there are cases where you might need to change it. For example, you could choose to convert certain operators to others to reduce the number of operators you have to implement (e.g. convert all `lt/e` to `gt/e` to only have to implement `gt/e`). When you invert such operators, you also have to invert `isNegated`.

	/**
	 * Similar to the valueComparer but for validating the ast before it's evaluated using @see Parser["validate"] (e.g. for syntax highlighting purposes). For the moment the ast must be valid (without syntax errors) to be validated.
	 *
	 * The only difference is nothing is actually evaluated (even though the values are available to the function\*) and the query contains the actual nodes/tokens for certain properties to make extracting positions easier.
	 *
	 * The function should return any positions of interest. These are collected and are returned as the result of the validate method. Basically it makes it easy to "tag" ranges. You're not restricted to returning just the position and you can use the generic argument to type additional properties you might return.
	 *
	 * \* The validate function won't attempt to fetch context values if no context is passed to the validate method (in which case the contextValue parameter will just be undefined).
	 *
	 * Example:
	 * Say we had a context that had a single nested key `a.b.c.d.e`.
	 *
	 * If a user inputs `a(c(d)) || e` we want to highlight all the prefixes from the first invalid "branch" (`c`). In the case of this input, the validator function is called for each innermost value (so twice, once for `d` and once for `e`).
	 *
	 * The first time (for `d`), the validator would receive a query whose `property` property would contain an array like: `[ValidToken(a), ValidToken(c), ValidToken(d)]`. We can do something like the following to "tag" `c` as the root of the problem, `d` as a sort of continuation of that error.
	 *
	 * Then the second time we will receive `[ValidToken(e)]`, which we can "tag" as some other error.
	 *
	 * ```ts
	 * valueValidator(_contextValue, query, context) {
	 * 	const values = query.propertyKeys
	 * 	let i = 1
	 * 	// where `get` is something like lodash's get
	 * 	while (i < query.property.length && get(context, values.slice(0, i)) !== undefined) {
	 * 		i++
	 * 	}
	 * 	if (i !== 0) {
	 * 		const invalid = query.property.slice(i - 1, query.property.length)
	 * 			.map(node => ({
	 * 				// use the node position to include any quotes in the position
	 * 				start: node.start,
	 * 				end: node.end,
	 * 				type: "InvalidPrefix",
	 * 			}))
	 * 			invalid[0].type = query.property.length === 1 ? "InvalidVariable" : "InvalidPrefixBranch"
	 * 		return invalid
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * // ...later
	 * // context could be a dummy context where all known properties are just true
	 * const errors => parser.validate(ast, context)
	 * // ... use the information to highlight those locations accordingly
	 * // a(c(d || e))
	 * //          ^InvalidVariable
